This repository contains some data obtained for the following paper:

"Comparing Multi-Training and Multi-Projection Approaches in Random Forest Classification for Earth Observation Land Cover Analysis"

The directory CLASSIFICATION contains two subdirectories with the projections of a random forest model on the Monti Pisani region, without the areas that experienced wildfires from 2001 onward, for the period from 2016 to 2024. 

The MULTI subdirectory contains the results obtained training the model using the same yearly time series used for the projection.

The SINGLE subdirectory contains the results obtained from training the model with the 2003 time series, which are then projected into years using the yearly time series of that year.
